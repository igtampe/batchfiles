## IGTAMPE DOS
The Magnum Opus of my Work, Igtampe DOS used to be a Replacement of the Boring stale CMD Window, but it soon became an attempt to recreate an Operating system under the Batch File Programming language. It comes packed with Applications and plenty of things to do for an astonishing 15 MINUTES! Yeah I know that isn't much but Igtampe DOS is a utility you probably won't use very often but when you do it is very useful. Download Now! The Igtampe DOS Website is igtdos.yolasite.com

  {LOCATION}:igtdos.yolasite.com/resources/CurrentRegular.iso
	{LOCATION (NETWORK EDITION)}:\Igtampe DOS Installation Disks\Igtampe Dos Network Edition\Igtampe DOS Cloud (1.4)\CLD.iso
	
## IGTAMPE DOS CE
The Sister program to IGTAMPE DOS, This program is for those who don't want the Gaudy and optional features of Igtampe DOS, but want the Application compatibility.

	{LOCATION}:\Igtampe DOS Installation Disks\Igtampe DOS CELL (CE1.4).iso

## MCOM
The ultimate in Compactness, This program is a Basic command line for Windows that makes it able for users to use the command Prompt Even if the administrator restricts them from doing so.

	{LOCATION}:\MiniCOM\MDOS.bat

## LOGIN
A fun little Program that asks you for prompts. One of my earliest programs (and it really shows)

	{LOCATION}:\My Programs\Login.bat.zip

## TREE
A Tree command gone Wild! This is just a Background app you can Run to make it look like you're hacking into some network.

	{LOCATION}:\TREEINST.bat
	{NOTES}: This is the Installer and it WILL delete itself after it's done.

## CoMo
The Ultimate Copier/Mover, CoMo (Short for CopyMove) is a fast File Copier that will copy ANY FILE (as long as it has no spaces in its directory or name) perfectly. The package includes everything, you’ll need. Usage is described in the readme. Enjoy!

	{LOCATION}:\My Programs\Copy-R

## Battery Checker
This is one of my most Useful Programs. Battery checker alerts you on your battery at 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, and 2%. Useful for those who want more reminders than the ones Windows Provides. It becomes small and sits on your desktop with an attractive color display with Green from 100%-25%, Yellow from 25%-10% and Red from 10%-2%. At each interval it gives you a message. At 2% it shuts off with one final message instructing you to turn off your PC. It also recognizes if you are running with an unchangeable battery or from a PC that has none. Easy to use and you won’t even notice it while it's not messaging you. Download Now!

	{LOCATION}:\My Programs\Battery Checker\BC4.bat

## CMDLINE
The Project Starter for Igtampe DOS, This is something in between IGTDOS CE and MCOM. Version 1.7 was just released with some updates and minor bug fixes. It was barely touched from 1.6. I also like keeping this as a Memoir of simpler times and for Retro Purposes.
	
  {LOCATION}:\My Programs\CMDLINE.bat

## Easy Text Reader
Just an easy text reader that will read any file. Just drag and drop into the program. Launching it without anything will cause it not to start. Use a Command Line to see the Usage page with the command “CALL ETR ?” Or “CALL ETR /?”

	{LOCATION}:\My Programs\ETR.bat
  {NOTES}: ETR has its own File Extension (.ETR) which may be used later in my Products.

## Matrix
Basically a Matrix look-alike Program.

	{LOCATION}:\My Programs\Matrix.bat

## Pop-up Generator
A Prank program which will create "Giant amounts" of Pop-ups for a User. With some preparation it will generate 20 Pop-ups per second, but eventually start skipping numbers at about the 50th pop-up. Will go away after a while so it won't crash the system. Each popup lasts about 1 Second and it will annoy the user. Have fun :D

```
  {LOCATION}:\My Programs\Pop-Up Generator.bat
  {NOTES}: This program will leave a note denoting how many Pop-ups were generated.
```

## Timer
A Basic Timer that has hours minutes and Seconds and is fairly accurate. It will send a message when it is done to the user and will remind them every 30 seconds.

Are you really reading this? Oh my god you are! Seriously though this is just a notice saying that, no, I don't hold rights to refrain you from copying these programs and yes, you can copy/pirate them, but really, for what? These programs are already free, and they are just strings of commands! Someone already probably programed these before me but didn't publish them! And if you want to get the Actual command executing programs behind all this you're going to have to deal with MICROSOFT! I don't think you want to do that, especially knowing how they treated you when dealing with your Xbox live account, no? I didn't think so. All in all, if you want to copy these, Fine. Just please put it somewhere that I was the creator or something!
